# Blue Moon Suites Quick Start

1) Download and install Meteor.js.

2) Within the terminal cd to the directory you wish to run our app from.

3) Enter the command "meteor create BMS" exactly.

4) There are quite a few packages you'll need to download through Meteor's package manager. Make sure all of these packages are added like so:
- meteor add accounts-password
- meteor add aslagle:reactive-table
- meteor add practicalmeteor:underscore.string
- meteor add reactive-dict
- meteor add reactive-var
- meteor add tsega:bootstrap3-datetimepicker
- meteor add underscore

5) After all of those have finished downloading please download our master zip file from our git. 

6) Extract the contents of master file within the zip file into your new app "BMS" folder. Overwrite anything that it requests.

7) Now type "meteor" within the terminal while your current directory is the BMS app folder and the website should be hosted locally on localhost:3000
