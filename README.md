# Blue Moon Suites Quick Start

1) Download and install Meteor.js. http://meteor.com/install

2) Within the terminal cd to the directory you wish to run our app from.

3) Enter the command "meteor create BMS" exactly.

4) There are quite a few packages you'll need to download through Meteor's package manager. Make sure all of these packages are added like so:
- meteor add accounts-password
- meteor add aslagle:reactive-table
- meteor add practicalmeteor:underscore.string
- meteor add reactive-dict
- meteor add reactive-var
- meteor add tsega:bootstrap3-datetimepicker
- meteor add underscore

5) After all of those have finished downloading please download our master zip file from our git. 

6) Extract the contents of master file within the zip file into your new app "BMS" folder. Overwrite anything that it requests.

7) Now type "meteor" within the terminal while your current directory is the BMS app folder and the website should be hosted locally on localhost:3000

## Some Notes

We do not take credit for admin.html, blank-page.html, bootstrap-elements.html, bootstrap-grid.html, and charts.html. These were put in strictly for show in the presentation to show what admin page we would've liked to hook up to our site if given more time or if we were more experienced.

In terms of source code grading the only code we made ourselves is either in the /public folder or within the /client folder. Code anywhere else is a precompiled library/framework element. Main.html is commented, but since we use the same templates for every page it didn't make sense to put the same comments on every page.

This git repository was remade due to when the first one was created, files were not organized as well, so the progress of our monthly attributes has been rewritten to a more earlier time stamp.
